# **COVID-19 Data Visualization in Malaysia**

This project presents an interactive data visualization storyboard analyzing Malaysia’s COVID-19 situation using textual, quantitative, temporal, and geospatial datasets.
The dashboard transforms pandemic data into visual insights that support awareness, education, and public health understanding.

# **📌 Objectives**
1. To develop an interactive data visualization storyboard that presents a comprehensive
overview of the COVID-19 situation in Malaysia using credible and up-to-date data
sources.
2. To visualize and analyse COVID-19-related data through the integration of
quantitative, temporal, and geospatial data.
3. To incorporate text data visualization that highlights key topics and public concerns
related to COVID-19 in Malaysia by extracting keywords from public health discussions.
